While media queries provide a method
to query aspects of the user agent or device environment
that a document is being displayed in
(such as viewport dimensions or user preferences),
container queries allow testing aspects
of elements within the document
(such as box dimensions or computed styles).

## My Notes

{{ collections.all | eleventyNavigation('container-queries') | eleventyNavigationToHtml | typogr | safe }}

## Specification

- [Editor's Draft](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-contain-3/)
- [Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-contain-3/)

## Issues

- [Github Project](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/projects/18)
- [Github Contain-3 Label](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acss-contain-3)
- [Request for TAG review](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/592)

## Support

- [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries)
  by **Rachel Andrew**
- [Can I use...](https://caniuse.com/css-container-queries)

## Implementations

- [Chromium](https://crbug.com/1145970) --
  in Chrome Canary, go to `chrome://flags` & "Enable CSS Container Queries"
  (This is a draft prototype and may not match the final design)

It's likely that no polyfill can perfectly emulate
the feature as specified,
but hopefully we can handle the most common use-cases.

- [CQFill](https://github.com/jsxtools/cqfill)
  by **Jonathan Neal** --
  still a very early prototype/proof-of-concept,
  requiring both pre-processor compilation (available for PostCSS)
  and run-time JS (using ResizeObserver).
